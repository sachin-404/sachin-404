<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sachin Kant</h1>

I am a Software Engineer primarily interested in AI/Backend/Infra/DevOps. I have a strong knowledge of various programming languages and technologies, including Python, Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.

I Joined Github **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago. Since then I pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests and contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** public repositories.

Most used languages across my projects:

{{ LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_START }}
![{{LANGUAGE_NAME}}](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=flat-square&label=%E2%A0%80&color=555&labelColor={{LANGUAGE_COLOR:uri}}&message={{LANGUAGE_NAME:uri}}%EF%B8%B1{{LANGUAGE_PERCENT:uri}}%25)
{{ LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_END }}
